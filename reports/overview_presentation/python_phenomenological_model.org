* Background
** Require simple to use data for anomaly detection project proof of concept
   Need data for 
   * Different severity
   * Different failure modes
    
** Started with matlab code by  [[This][Buzonni, Elia, Cocconcelli]]  
    Did not understand phenomenological models and the code so:
    * Annotated all the matlab [[file:~/projects/PhD/code/phenomenological_model/matlab_model/bearingSignalModelLocal.m::Geometry pamerter not including n_balls is not consistent with paper. n_balls incorporated later which could be confusing.][code]] explaining what each line does.
     
    Ran into some speed issues and also needed to manipulate the model more easily.
    * Built a vectorised, and modular Python version
     
** Initially, the main purpose of model was to teach myself about phenomenological models


* The model
** Notable differences from the Matlab model
   * Defines speed profile in the time domain
   * Convolution, transients, cumulation, noise etc. vectorized (i.e. arrays)
       Leads to a big speedup in computation
   * Included comments that explain what the code does.
   * Makes use of a "master"-sample rate that represents continuous time.
   * Transient duration is dependent on the system properties: Damping and natural frequency.
   * Currently only for local faults

** How to use it
   * Demo
   * All specifications for simulation defined in .yaml file
     
** What does the code do?
   

* Uncertainties and weak points
** Definition of the SDOF transient excitation
*** Buzonni makes makes use of double integration time solution.
     My understanding is that they effectively assume that displacement and velocity initial conditions are both zero.
*** Discontinuities in Acceleration VS. initial zero acceleration?
*** Choosing to define severity in terms of acceleration magnitude and not F and K dependent 
    * Get standard response between 0 and 1.
    * Rescale according to required acceleration magnitude.

** Definition of amplitude modulation for a inner race fault. 
** For most useful data format?
   Currently, for each severity, failure mode, system parameters:
   * Several measurements are created
** Fault phase ie. when does the first fault occur.
** Realistic settings for fault magnitude
** Validation
   Is there a dataset with known parameters that I can use to validate the model
